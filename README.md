# WreckMyStuff

WreckMyStuff is a 3D physics-based destruction game where the player can move freely in all dimensions and launch projectiles at various objects. The game has been built entirely using Unreal Engine Blueprints.

## Gameplay
- The player controls movement in three dimensions, allowing for full exploration of the environment.
- Players can throw metal balls (projectiles) at destructible objects like cars, barrels, trucks, drums, and more.
- The game features a limited ammo system. Once all the projectiles are used, the game resets.

## Features
- 3D Movement: Full freedom to explore and engage with the environment.
- Projectile Physics: Realistic physics-based projectiles (metal balls) that interact with objects.
- Destructible Objects: Targets include cars, barrels, trucks, and drums.
- Limited Ammo System: After all projectiles are thrown, the game restarts.

## Development Process
The project has been developed using Unreal Engine's Blueprints system. During the development of **WreckMyStuff**, I learned and implemented several key features:
- Creating functions and handling variables in Blueprints.
- Understanding and using transforms to position and move objects.
- Abstracting functionality to create reusable Blueprints.

## How to Play
1. Use keyboard or controller to move in the 3D environment.
2. Aim and throw metal balls at various objects in the scene.
3. Once you've used all your projectiles, the game restarts automatically.

## Future Improvements
- Adding different levels with increasing difficulty.
- Introducing new types of projectiles and objects.
- Implementing advanced UI and score tracking.

## Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5 (or higher)
- PC with mid-level specs

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Unreal Engine.
3. Press play to start the game.
